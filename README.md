# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X and O) until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- Player vs Player gameplay
- Interactive command-line interface
- Basic error handling for invalid moves
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and extension

## Getting Started
To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java source code (`TicTacToe.java`).
3. Compile the source code using the Java compiler:
   ```
   javac TicTacToe.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java TicTacToe
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Usage
- The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, with each cell initially marked with a hyphen (-).
- Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column of the cell they want to mark.
- The game ends when one player achieves three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled without a winner.
